 Following the 2001 MLB season, the Oakland Athletics saw the departure of three key players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen).  That season they finished second in the American League with a record of 102-60, but lost to the 3 games to 2 against the New York Yankeees in the American League Division Series.  Looking to repeat their success and compete against the New York Yankees, they would need to find a way to replace the key players lost.  Limited to a 44 million dollar salary, how can the Oakland Athletics bring in enough talent to compare to the New York Yankees 125 million dollar payroll.  Using rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better indicators of offensive success, and the Athletics became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact.  The goal is to find undervalued players that fulfill the new Athletics criteria for offensive success with a 13 million dolllar salary cap.
