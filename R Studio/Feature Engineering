1. Using prior baseball knowledge I know that batting averages are the amount of Hits divided by the amount of At Bats.  Calculated
2. Double check the operation.  Check the last five entries
3. Add On Base percentage, Slugging, and singles column.  Calculate
4. Double check structure

batting$BA <- batting$H / batting$AB
tail(batting$BA,5)
batting$OBP <- (batting$H + batting$BB + batting$HBP)/(batting$AB + batting$BB + batting$HBP + batting$SF) --- On base percentage
batting$SLG <- ((1 * batting$X1B) + (2 * batting$X2B) + (3 * batting$X3B) + (4 * batting$HR) ) / batting$AB --- Slugging
batting$X1B <- batting$H - batting$X2B - batting$X3B - batting$HR --- Singles
str(batting)
