1. Collect the combination data frame consisting of the three lost players
2. Wrangle the data only from 2001
3. Filter the data into only having the playerID, doubles, triples, homerums, on base percentage, slugging, batting average, and at bats columns
4. Find all avaliable players from 2001
5. Make a scatter plot
6. Get rid of all players with a salary greater than 10 million, at bats less than 1500, and sort by on base percentage.
7. Sort columns
